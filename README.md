## Technologies Used: 
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express.js
- Node.js
- DotEnv

## Getting Started:
- Orignal plan of revamping my Music App had to be scrapped due to time constraints so I had to swap to doing a basic to do list app.
- App includes full CRUD functionality with the Create, Read, and Delete features integrated with the front-end. GitHub link to [front end](github.com/C3-PIO/ToDoList).

## Unsolved Problems:
- All CRUD requests are working with the database

## Future Enhancements:
- Use timestamps included in the Todo Schema so that list items can be sorted by date/time
